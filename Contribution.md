# Contribution

Feel free to suggest any project that is not currently present in iOS-Projects-Catalogue:

- Fork iOS-Projects-Catalogue.
- Create branch 'new', switch to it.
- Add your project.
- Bump the date of last update.
- Make a pull request named "Add Category/Subcategory: YourProject". See [Commits](https://github.com/stanislaw/iOS-Projects-Catalogue/commits/master) for examples.

If you are not sure about particular project, place it to the list of [Candidates](https://github.com/stanislaw/iOS-Projects-Catalogue/blob/master/CANDIDATES.md) as I do. We can decide later if it deserves its place in the main catalogue.

New projects are welcome!
